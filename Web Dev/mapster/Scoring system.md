## Overview

This game uses a Geoguessr-style scoring system based on the distance between your guess and the actual location of the satellite image.

  

## Scoring Formula

  

### Basic Score Calculation

```

Score = max(0, 5000 - (distance_km * 2.5))

```

  

- **Maximum Score**: 5,000 points (perfect guess at exact location)

- **Minimum Score**: 0 points (very far guesses)

- **Distance Factor**: 2.5 points deducted per kilometer

  

### Score Ranges by Distance

  

| Distance Range | Score Range | Description |

|---------------|-------------|-------------|

| 0 - 1 km | 4,750 - 5,000 pts | Excellent guess |

| 1 - 10 km | 4,500 - 4,750 pts | Very good guess |

| 10 - 100 km | 4,250 - 4,500 pts | Good guess |

| 100 - 500 km | 3,750 - 4,250 pts | Fair guess |

| 500 - 1,000 km | 2,500 - 3,750 pts | Poor guess |

| 1,000 - 2,000 km | 0 - 2,500 pts | Very poor guess |

| 2,000+ km | 0 pts | Maximum distance penalty |

  

## Game Structure

## Implementation Notes

  

### Score Calculation Function

```python

def calculate_score(distance_km: float) -> int:

"""

Calculate score based on distance using Geoguessr-style formula.

Args:

distance_km: Distance between guess and actual location in kilometers

Returns:

Score from 0 to 5000 points

"""

if distance_km < 0:

return 5000

score = max(0, 5000 - (distance_km * 2.5))

return int(round(score))

```
