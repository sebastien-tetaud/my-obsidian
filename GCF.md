The Green Climate Fund (GCF) – a critical element of the historic Paris Agreement - is the world’s largest climate fund. It was created by the 194 countries that are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP 16) in Cancun, Mexico, in 2010, and has officially operated since 2015. The GCF's mission is to support developing countries in their efforts to combat climate change by providing financial resources for projects, programs, policies, and other activities aimed at both mitigation and adaptation.  
  
**Goals and Objectives**  
The primary objectives of the GCF are to:  

- Limit or Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions: By financing projects that promote low-emission and climate-resilient development.
- Adaptation: Helping communities adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change.
- Catalyze Climate Finance: Mobilizing additional funding from both public and private sectors to achieve a paradigm shift towards sustainable development.

The GCF aims to distribute its resources equally between mitigation and adaptation efforts, with a special focus on the most vulnerable countries, including Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and African nations.  
  
**Governance Structure**  
The governance of the GCF is designed to ensure balanced representation and transparency:  
**Board:** The GCF is governed by a Board comprising 24 members with equal representation from developed and developing countries. The Board is responsible for approving projects and setting the strategic direction of the fund.  
**Secretariat:** The GCF Secretariat, headquartered in Songdo, South Korea, supports the Board's operations, manages day-to-day activities, and coordinates project approvals and fund disbursements.  
  
**Project Approval and Implementation**  
The GCF supports a wide range of activities, from large infrastructure projects to community-based initiatives. The approval process generally follows these steps:  

- Concept Note Submission: Project proponents submit an initial concept note outlining the project’s objectives, scope, and expected impacts.
- Funding Proposal Development: Detailed funding proposals are developed with support from accredited entities, ensuring they meet the GCF’s standards and safeguards.
- Board Approval: The GCF Board reviews and approves funding proposals based on their merit, feasibility, and alignment with GCF objectives.
- Implementation and Monitoring: Approved projects are implemented with continuous monitoring and evaluation to ensure compliance and effectiveness.
