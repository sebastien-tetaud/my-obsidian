Embedding a video in Markdown is a simple process that can be accomplished using a few different methods.

One way to embed a video in Markdown is to use the HTML `<video>` tag. This tag allows you to specify the video file that you want to embed, as well as several other options such as the width and height of the video player, whether or not the video should autoplay, and whether or not to display controls. For example, to embed a video in Markdown using the `<video>` tag, you would use the following code:

```markdown
<video src="path/to/video.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>
```
