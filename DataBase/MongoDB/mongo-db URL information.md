Let's break down each element of this URL:

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@mongodb-3baed69e-ob7dcf057.database.cloud.ovh.net/admin?replicaSet=replicaset&tls=true

```

### Protocol

- `mongodb+srv://`
    - This indicates that you're using the MongoDB SRV (Service) connection string format. SRV records in DNS are used to provide connection information for the database, including server addresses and ports.

### Credentials

- `<username>:<password>`
    - `username`: This is the username for authenticating with the MongoDB database.
    - `password`: This is the password for the specified username.
    - These credentials are used to authenticate the connection. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the actual username and password.

### Host

- `mongodb-3baed69e-ob7dcf057.database.cloud.ovh.net`
    - This is the host address of your MongoDB server. In this case, it appears to be hosted on OVHcloud.

### Database

- `/admin`
    - This specifies the database to connect to upon successful connection. The `admin` database is a special database in MongoDB used for administrative purposes.

### Query Parameters

- `?replicaSet=replicaset&tls=true`
    - These are additional options specified as query parameters.

### `replicaSet=replicaset`

- This specifies the name of the replica set to connect to. A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod instances that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and high availability.

### `tls=true`

- This option enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the connection, which ensures that the data transmitted between the client and the server is encrypted.

### Summary

Combining all parts, the URL provides all necessary information for the MongoDB client to:

1. Use the SRV protocol to look up the necessary connection details.
2. Authenticate using the provided username and password.
3. Connect to the specified host.
4. Use the `admin` database.
5. Join the specified replica set.
6. Encrypt the connection using TLS.

When using this connection string, make sure to replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual MongoDB credentials. Here is an example with placeholders replaced:

```
mongodb+srv://myUser:myPassword@mongodb-3baed69e-ob7dcf057.database.cloud.ovh.net/admin?replicaSet=replicaset&tls=true

```

TIPS

- [ ] It is better to develop with a public database to perform some test and then deploy in the private vpc
