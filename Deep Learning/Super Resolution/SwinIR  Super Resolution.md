### Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer

SwinIR (Swin Transformer for Image Restoration) is a **deep learning model** designed for **image super-resolution (SR), denoising, and compression artifact reduction**. It builds upon the **Swin Transformer**, which is known for its **hierarchical structure and shifted window mechanism**, making it highly effective for capturing both **local and global dependencies** in images.

SwinIR was introduced in the paper:  
**"SwinIR: Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer" (Liang et al., 2021).**  
It **outperforms CNN-based methods** (like SRCNN, RCAN, and EDSR) by leveraging **self-attention mechanisms** and **hierarchical feature extraction**.
